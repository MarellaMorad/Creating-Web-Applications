        <h2>Usability, Functionality and Maintainability Enhancements</h2>
        <p class="overall-intro">
            These enhancements aim to improve the usability, functionality
            and maintainability of this website. Various features such as
            validation indicators, new HTML elements, and color palettes
            have been added to enhance the user experience. These
            improvements were made to create a more engaging and interactive
            experience for users.
        </p>
        <details>
            <summary>
                Validation Indicators and Style-changing Navbar using
                <strong>CSS</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
                These changes have been implemented to provide the user with
                additional feedback and interactivity, as well as enhancing
                the visual design of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Validation indicators have been added to form inputs
                including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The red <span class="red-star">*</span> for required
                    fields implemented using the CSS
                    <code>::after</code> pseudo-element -
                    <em>
                        see
                        <a href="jobs.html">jobs.html</a>.
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having input fields highlighted in red with a red border
                    when the input is invalid. This is implemented using the
                    CSS <code>:invalid</code> pseudo-class -
                    <em> see <a href="jobs.html">jobs.html</a>. </em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Also, I made some style changes for the navbar to indicate
                for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The current page - background color of the navbar item
                    changes to purple and text color changes to white which
                    is implemented using a custom css class
                    <code>.current</code> that indicates the current page -
                    <em>
                        try selecting a different page and see how the
                        styling changes!
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This change is also visible on hover which is
                    implemented using the CSS
                    <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class -
                    <em>
                        try hovering over different menu item and see how
                        the styling changes!</em>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </summary>
            <p>
                These new HTML elements are in place to improve the user
                experience by providing additional interactivity, multimedia
                content, and organization of information.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An iframe element has been added to embed and display a
                    Facebook video of me singing which is part of the
                    <a href="aboutMe.html">aboutMe.html page</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    An audio element has been added to play an voice-note of
                    me showing my
                    <a href="aboutMe.html">bilingual skills</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiple <code>details</code> elements have been added
                    to allow content to be collapsed and expanded by the
                    user. This enhances interactivity allowing users to
                    select the content they want to view. I also used the
                    <em><strong>open</strong></em> Boolean attribute
                    indicates whether or not the details element contents
                    are currently visible. You can see this on the
                    <a href="jobs.html">Position Description</a>
                    page as well as
                    <a href="enhancements.html">this</a> page
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Third-party sources used include the W3C HTML specification

            <p>
                This helps establish a visual identity, improve the user
                experience, simplify the design process and improve
                maintainability and consistency of the website. It is a
                small but impactful detail that can make a big difference in
                the overall look and feel of a website
            </p>
            <p>
                It goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment by
                demonstrating a commitment to consistent branding and
                design, which can improve the user experience and make the
                website more memorable.
            </p>
            <p>
                To specify a consistent color palette for the website, I
                used the CSS <code>:root</code> pseudo-class to define
                variables for each color, such as
                <code>light-purple, dark-purple</code>.... Then, I used
                these variables throughout my CSS code to apply consistent
                colors to various HTML elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I referred to the CSS-Tricks website to learn more about
                using the
                <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/r/root/">:root pseudo-class</a>
                and defining variables in CSS
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see the implementation of this enhancement
                throughout my website. The colors used in the header,
                footer, buttons, and other elements are consistent across
                all web pages, providing a unified look and feel.

        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p class="overall-intro">
            A responsive website provides a better user experience to
            visitors by making the website easily accessible and readable on
            any device. It ensures that the content and functionality of the
            website are easily accessible and optimized for the screen size
            of the device being used. This enhances user engagement and
            encourages visitors to stay on the website longer.
        </p>
        <details>
            <summary>
                The use of <code>@media</code> queries
            </summary>
            <p>
                Making the website responsive is an important feature that
                goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment as it
                ensures that the website is easily accessible on different
                screen sizes, ranging from desktops to mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>To make the website responsive:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I first needed to add a <code>meta tag</code> in my HTML
                    to support and respond correctly to the
                    <code>@media</code> queries
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then I was able to use <code>@media</code> queries in my
                    CSS code to control the HTML elements on certain screen
                    sizes. I set a breakpoint for medium screens at
                    <code>869px</code> and for small screens at
                    <code>450px</code>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                After setting up the <code>@media</code> queries in my CSS
                code, I defined some HTML elements that will only show on
                smaller/small screens, such as the small-menu section
            </p>
            <p>
                I referred to the
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">Mozilla
                    Developer Network</a>
                to implement responsive design in my website and learn how
                to use the <code>@media</code> queries.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see the implementation of responsive design
                throughout my website. For example, if you resize the
                browser window or view the website on a mobile device, you
                will notice that the layout and styling of the website
                adjusts accordingly. One main thing that you may notice is
                the navbar items changing from <strong>text</strong> (on
                large screens) to
                <strong><a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons">Font Awesome</a>
                    icons</strong>
                (on medium and small screens).
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                Font Awesome Icons
            </summary>
            <p>
                Font Awesome has been used as an external stylesheet to
                provide icons for the website's menu on smaller screens, as
                well as links to the my social media profiles. This enhances
                visual interest and functionality
            </p>
            <p>Code needed to implement this includes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Linking to the Font Awesome stylesheet in the HTML
                    document's head section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding span elements and setting their classes according
                    to the
                    <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons">Font Awesome documentations</a>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You can see this enhancement in action on the navbar menu
                (available on all web pages on medium and small screens) and
                the social media links on the
                <a href="aboutMe.html">aboutMe</a> page - right above the
                footer.
