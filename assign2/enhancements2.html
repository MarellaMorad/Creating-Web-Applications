                Responsive Form Validation using Event Listeners
            </summary>
            <p>
                Using event listeners allows for responsive validation, which can improve the user experience by
                providing immediate feedback to the user if they have made a mistake. This can also help prevent users
                from submitting forms with incorrect data, saving time and effort for both the user and the developer.
            </p>
            <h3>Trigger:</h3>
            <p>
                A user simply needs to start typing in a form input field. As they type, the validation function
                associated with that field is called to check the input and display any error messages if necessary.
            </p>
            <h3>Implementation:</h3>
            <p>
                I added event listeners to the form inputs that trigger
                validation functions as the user enters data. For example,I used <code>input.addEventListener("input",
                    validationFunction())</code> to add an event listener to an input element that calls the
                <code>validationFunction()</code>
                every time the user enters data. Within the <code>validationFunction()</code>,the user input gets
                checked and if not valid an appropriate error message gets displayed.
            </p>
            <P>
                Instead of grouping the error messages and displaying them in an alert box, I used <code>span</code>
                elements to display an error underneath each input field that has invalid data that shows a relevant
                message regarding the validation of the data.
            </P>

            <summary>Improved website navigation with dynamic menu rendering using JavaScript</summary>
            <p>
                This has been implemented to enhances the responsiveness of my website by using JavaScript to render and
                style the appropriate menu based on the screen size. This allows the website to adapt to different
                screen sizes and provide a better user experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Trigger:</h3>
            <p>
                To trigger the event, a user would simply adjust the screen size (either increase or decrease) and the
                menu will response accordingly. Also, when a user selects a certain page, the menu item of that page
                would be styled differently indicating the active page.
            </p>
            <h3>Implementation:</h3>
            <p>
                To implement the feature, I created a new JS file - <code>menu.js</code> - and defined two main
                functions:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>adjustMenu():</code>
                    <p>
                        This function computes the screen size using <code>window.innerWidth</code> and applies CS
                        styling to the menu elements accordingly. The CS styling is added from an external CS stylesheet
                        called fontAwesomeIcons by adding relevant classes to each of the menu items and removing them
                        on larger screens.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setActivePage()</code>
                    <p>
                        This function relies on the <code>window.location.href</code> property and compares it to the
                        list of <code>nav-links</code> and once they are equal, adds the <code>active</code> class to
                        the active page.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                You can see the implementation of responsive design
                throughout my website. For example, if you resize the
                browser window or view the website on a mobile device, you
                will notice that the layout and styling of the website
                adjusts accordingly. One main thing that you may notice is
                the navbar items changing from <strong>text</strong> (on
                large screens) to
                <strong><a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons">Font Awesome</a>
                    icons</strong>
                (on medium and small screens).

        <h2>Code Refactoring</h2>
        <p class="overall-intro">
            This enhancement involved restructuring the validation code to make it more modular and easier to maintain.
            This was done in three steps:
        </p>
        <details open>
            <summary>Defining a Class to Manage Form Fields</summary>
            <p>
                This enhancement was made to promote encapsulation, reusability, extensibility, and
                abstraction. It enabled me to group relevant information of a field into a single unit, making it easier
                to manage the form field's state and behavior, and create multiple instances without repeating code. It
                provided a higher level of abstraction, allowing me to focus on the form field's behavior
                and state rather than managing individual variables and event listeners.
            </p>
            <h3>Trigger</h3>
            <p>There isn't a specific trigger for the user to run this enhancement.</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>To implement this, I first defined a class using the following:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    class FormField {
                        constructor(inputId, errId, validateFn) {
                            this.input = document.getElementById(inputId);
                            this.errSpan = document.getElementById(errId);
                            this.validate = validateFn.bind(this);
                            this.input.addEventListener("input", this.validate);
                        }
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Which then enabled me to change my code from this</p>
            <h4>Before:</h4>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const firstName = document.getElementById("first-name"); 
                    const firstNameErr = document.getElementById("first-name-err"); 
                    firstName.addEventListener('input', function () { 
                        validateName(this.input, this.errSpan, "First Name"); 
                    });
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>To this:</p>
            <h4>After:</h4>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const firstNameField = new FormField("first-name", "first-name-err", function () { 
                        validateName(this.input, this.errSpan, "First Name"); 
                    });
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Following this approach allowed me to use less variables, further organise my code and implement
                typechecking on my form fields.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details open>
            <summary>Breaking the big validation function into smaller functions</summary>
            <p>
                This enhancement is common practice in software development to improve code Maintainability,
                Understandability, Reusability, and Debugging. I chose this approach as some of the form fields
                share the same validation, for example: firstName and lastName should both be alphabetical characters,
                max 20. So, I created the validateName function and passed the relevant information to meet the custom
                part of the validation while sharing the rest of the validation logic with the other name field. To
                further refactor my code, I used some <strong>helper</strong> functions, such as the <br>
                <code>validateInput(inputElement, errorElement, errorMessage, regex = "", regexErrMsg = "") { }</code><br>
                function which takes in the input element, and validates if it has a value, and also checks if it meets
                the given regex (when applicable). This drastically reduced the amount of code duplication that would
                have been included otherwise.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details open>
            <summary>Defining Form Fields and passing them around functions instead of calling
                <code>document.getElementById</code> Multiple times
            </summary>
            <p>
                This last step depends on the previous two steps in the sense that having the FormFields Class, and
                Refactoring into small functions enabled me to do this step to further improve the performance and
                readability of me code.
